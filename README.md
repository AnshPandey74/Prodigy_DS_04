# Prodigy_DS_04 EDA README

## Steps for README Documentation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x and required dependencies like seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas are installed.
3. Open the EDA file (Prodigy_DS_04.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run cells to reproduce analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset Type
- The Twitter dataset contains information about tweets with sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and relevant comments.

## Data Preprocessing
- Imported the dataset from 'twitter.csv' into a pandas DataFrame.
- Checked for and handled null values in the 'comment' column.
- Calculated the total number of unique values in the DataFrame.

## Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzed the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset using the `value_counts()` method.
- Visualized the sentiment distribution using pie charts and bar plots.

## Conclusion
- The EDA on the Twitter dataset provides insights into sentiment patterns and public opinion towards specific topics or brands.
- The dataset predominantly contains positive sentiments, with a significant portion of tweets expressing positive sentiment.
- It's important to note that sentiment analysis can be subjective and may not always accurately capture the true meaning or context of the tweets.
